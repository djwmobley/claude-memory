## Skill invocation hints

- `/handoff:status` — show last close, days since close, entity/assertion counts
- `/handoff:resume` — load context from prior session regardless of staleness
- `/handoff:close` — end-of-session extraction: entities, assertions, edges, contract update
- `/handoff:checkpoint` — mid-session save without ending the session
- `/handoff:drop` — archive prior session memory and start fresh
- `/handoff:purge` — hard delete all project memory (confirmation required)

## Key paths

- Handoff file: `{{HANDOFF_MD_PATH}}`
- Helper script: `{{PROJECT_ROOT}}/scripts/handoff.js`

---

## Durable facts

- (No durable facts promoted yet — promoted by `/handoff:close` when confidence ≥ 9 and user_stated across multiple sessions)
